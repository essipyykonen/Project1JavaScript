Description: This application is supposed to be a personal To-Do list maker. It's a simple tool to help users organize their tasks efficiently, to manage multiple lists and track their progress.

Evaluation: I am hoping that this application is at least satisfactory. But I'd say it could be evaluated as good (20 points). I made sure that the code has comments, it has this Readme-file, it's in GitHub and Netlify, and the code should be working fine.
